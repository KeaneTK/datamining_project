The towering, action-packed logo is a further sardonic comment on the lack of activity in the protagonist's life. There's as much at stake in this hilarious, moody and cantankerous film adaptation of &quot;Splendor&quot; as there was in this summer's other movies of comics anti-heroes like &quot;The Hulk&quot; and &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.&quot; Harvey is extraordinary \u2014 by the way, so is this movie. As played by Paul Giamatti, Harvey's a gray wad of anger that spends his time in his cave-like apartment, with shelves sagging under the weight of his collection of record albums and jazz 78's. And sputtering to his equally powerless pals about a world that he refuses to understand. Slumped into a posture that's a question mark with a pot-belly, Mr. Giamatti's a frustrated tremor, shaking and gesticulating futilely. The filmmakers use the real Mr. Pekar as a narrator initially. For a time, the film cuts to the real-life Pekar, fulminating onscreen with his friends against a stark-white background. This sounds like a mocking, distancing device \u2014 and in the wrong hands, it would be. But the real-life Pekar is as vivid in his way as Mr. Giamatti. The actual Pekaris a flinty crank spouting while the actors portraying figures from the streets of Cleveland chuckle in disbelief at him and his obsessive, nerdy friends, like Toby (played in the film with breath-taking precision by Judah Friedlander). The great cast also includes Earl Billings as Mr. Boats, one of Harvey bellicose, small-minded and larger-than-life co-workers, and Danny Hoch. Harvey's romantic match, Joyce Brabner, is played with a tart, intriguing directness by Hope Davis that's equal parts Emma Goldman and Olive Oyl \u2014  that is, the Olive Oyl of the comics, not the screaming helpless No. 2 pencil of the cartoons. And the picture becomes something richer and fuller when Joyce enters the film.

Jennifer Lopez, Mr. Affleck's real-life fianc\u00e9e, is a lesbian organized-crime professional assigned to make sure he doesn't mess up. But the stars, and Martin Brest, who has a decent record of competence (&quot;Beverly Hills Cop,&quot; &quot;Midnight Run,&quot; &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;), mess up just about everything. The picture  \u2014  a drab, talky amalgam of &quot;Rain Man,&quot; &quot;Prizzi's Honor&quot; and &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; \u2014 is mostly dull and shapeless. But the torpor is leavened by some howlingly awful sexual repartee, and by the brief appearances of Christopher Walken and Al Pacino, called in as designated over-actors, and who are at least bad on purpose. \u2014 A.

The movie is sublimely silly  &#151; as empty, elegant and beguiling as a magazine advertisement for an expensive watch &#151; but the director's evident pleasure, his impeccable CinemaScope compositions and the lush, suave score by Michel Legrand make it a seductive diversion. &#151; A.O.
