We see this in the first sequence, when the belligerently jealous Mario (Ren\u00e9 Wanko) threatens the guys who look at his girlfriend, Klaudia (Franziska Weiss); he seems to leave pools of testosterone wherever he steps. After he forces her unwanted suitors away and floors his car through the streets of Vienna, he screams at Klaudia and throws her out of the car. We then get the credit sequence, with several groups of people shown sunning themselves under the piercing sun; the pictures could be a melting mess bringing together Francis Bacon and David Hockney. With these shots of the pale cast of characters, we can almost feel the melanoma developing. Mr. Seidl treats the chemistry of human relationships like a cancer, an enormous growth that, unchecked, leads to disease. And he fixates on flesh, scouring it with his camera to search for a trace of the humanity within. He doesn't find much; the men and women in &quot;Dog Days&quot; are broken down into bullies and victims. Mr. Seidl, who wrote the screenplay with Veronika Franz, seems determined to make an answer to &quot;American Beauty.&quot; The picture is set in a tract-house suburb, with identical houses crammed next to one another, and the lack of space and the heat make an appropriate context for the wanton mistreatment. But there is genuine curiosity in Mr. Seidl's filmmaking; he treats his story as if he were shooting a documentary. The believability comes from the casting: Mr. Seidl has found a group of actors and nonprofessionals who interact spectacularly well. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null, "display_title": "Dog Days", "critics_pick": 1, "mpaa_rating": "Not Rated", "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:44:05", "opening_date": null, "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9805E1DB143AF932A35757C0A9649C8B63", "type": "article", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Dog Days"}, "publication_date": "2002-04-01"}, {"byline": "Elvis Mitchell", "headline": "Inner Tour, The (Movie)", "summary_short": "", "multimedia": null, "display_title": "The Inner Tour", "critics_pick": 0, "mpaa_rating": "", "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:48:57", "opening_date": null, "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E4DB143AF932A35757C0A9649C8B63", "type": "article", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of The Inner Tour"}, "publication_date": "2002-04-01"}, {"byline": "A.
