At the beginning, it looks as if &quot;American Desi&quot; might seriously tackle some of the problems of cultural identity that Krishna's situation brings up. But once he arrives at college, the movie settles for being a light romantic comedy in which he struggles to win the heart of Nina Shah (Purva Bedi), an Indian-American beauty who values traditional culture. &#151; Stephen Holden\r\n", "multimedia": null, "display_title": "American Desi", "critics_pick": 0, "mpaa_rating": "Not Rated", "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:19:33", "opening_date": null, "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9505E4DD173DF935A25750C0A9679C8B63", "type": "article", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of American Desi"}, "publication_date": "2001-03-16"}, {"byline": "Stephen Holden", "headline": "Dish, the (Movie)", "summary_short": "This likable film about the 1969 Apollo XI mission as experienced in Australia recalls the crucial role played by a  satellite dish outside of the rural town of Parkes, New South Wales, in transmitting live  images of the moon landing.
