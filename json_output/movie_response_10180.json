For all its painstaking historical detail, this &quot;Titanic&quot; proves anything but quaint, thanks to the phenomenal immediacy of its sights and the pure Hollywood hokum of its story. As two young lovers whose romance is skillfully interwoven with real historical detail, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are a duo with serious chemistry.
