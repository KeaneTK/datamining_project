The movie employs modeled latex figures to tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Nick Park, who also directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Peter Lord's continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority. ''Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ''Stalag 17'' to ''Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Mel Gibson, the voice of Rocky, the matinee-idol flying rooster who is asked to teach the hens to fly. Finally, it shows that the hens can save themselves through the pluck of Ginger (Julia Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal of this. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null, "display_title": "Chicken Run", "critics_pick": 1, "mpaa_rating": "G", "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:41:59", "opening_date": "2000-06-23", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE2DB1331F932A15755C0A9669C8B63", "type": "article", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Chicken Run"}, "publication_date": "2000-06-21"}, {"byline": "A.
