But the movie is undermined by Brian De Palma's uncharacteristic wet-eyed awe. All this addled sincerity comes from trying to create wonderment for adults, growing out of a morose astronaut's rediscovery of his humanity on Mars. Gary Sinise plays the depressed astronaut, and his thoughtful patience makes him appear to be a little sluggish, though not as sluggish as the movie: narratively it seems to be taking place in zero gravity, where each minute seems to last an additional 30 seconds. In space no one can hear you snore. &#151; Elvis Mitchell\r\n", "multimedia": null, "display_title": "Mission to Mars", "critics_pick": 0, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:58:06", "opening_date": "2000-03-10", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9804E6D81F38F933A25750C0A9669C8B63", "type": "article", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Mission to Mars"}, "publication_date": "2000-03-10"}, {"byline": "Stephen Holden", "headline": "Deterrence (Movie)  ", "summary_short": "Middle East crisis could go nuclear.
