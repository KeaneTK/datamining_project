The title comes from the British director Alan Clarke's 1989 rough-and-ready short film of the same name, a tough and dense look at the   violence in northern Ireland, which also didn't paste answers onto the  problem. Mr. Clarke's short outraged or absorbed viewers in the way Mr. Van  Sant's movie, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, is likely to do. (Mr. Clarke's title referred to the aphorism about the elephant in the living room \u2014 a problem that people refuse to face for so long that they are no longer even able to  see it.) &quot;Elephant&quot; will confound audiences looking for solutions or villains, because it doesn't supply them. There's no narrator perched  omnisciently over the events, nor the kinds of exaggerated melodramatics  and pop music that teen movies employ to insistently nag at emotions. There are few recognizable actors, since Mr. Van Sant populated the movie with   kids who had never acted before, heightening the realism and the tension. Mr. Van Sant gives &quot;Elephant&quot; a Spartan yet elusive life by shifting the film's focus from one group of  students to another; the camera actually drifts like a bored high school student.  And by the end of the movie, we realize where much of the power and clarity of the film comes  from. By making the camera an observer, we get a perspective  that often comes out of horror movies, a choice that whips the ordinary  with the terrifying \u2014  an unforgettable mix. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null, "display_title": "Elephant", "critics_pick": 1, "mpaa_rating": "R", "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:16:57", "opening_date": "2003-11-14", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=980CEED6163FF933A25753C1A9659C8B63", "type": "article", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Elephant"}, "publication_date": "2003-10-10"}, {"byline": "Elvis Mitchell", "headline": "A Lawyer's Good Teeth Help in Court and Love", "summary_short": "This Coen Brothers film is something not seen in movie theaters for a long time: an intelligent, modern screwball comedy, a minor classic on the order of the competent, fast-talking curveballs about deception and greed like Mitchell Leisen's &quot;Easy Living&quot; and Billy Wilder's &quot;Major and the Minor.&quot; &quot;Cruelty&quot; shares something with comedic entries in the Coen canon like &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; and &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;: a full-blooded movie star performance to put it squarely into the strike zone. This time the good work comes from George Clooney. His gift of gab is perfectly suited for Miles, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of divorce lawyers. Miles has everything but a soul, though he doesn't actually look as if he'd require one. And the babe he falls for isn't exactly the person to give him one either. Marilyn (Catherine  Zeta-Jones), as delectable as a white-chocolate Easter Bunny, has been tagged for a vicious divorce by her husband, a serial adulterer, after she catches him cheating. Her uptown-girl beauty and silken opacity make her the kind of trophy Miles would want to win. And when she jabs a No. 2 pencil into Miles's heart by showing up with her beau, a Texas millionaire (Billy Bob Thornton), Miles is horrified, but not defeated. That's what makes the picture work so beautifully; it is a film about underhanded professionals by filmmakers who delight in the epitome of criminal enterprise. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null, "display_title": "Intolerable Cruelty", "critics_pick": 1, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:42:51", "opening_date": "2003-10-10", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9400E5DC173FF933A25753C1A9659C8B63", "type": "article", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Intolerable Cruelty"}, "publication_date": "2003-10-10"}], "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.
