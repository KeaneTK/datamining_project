The unlikely, complicated passion between Martin, the troubled illegitimate son of a wealthy industrialist, and Alice, a brittle violinist, unfolds against an equally complicated and sometimes overcrowded background of family secrets and shifting domestic alliances.

As played by Mike White, who also wrote the screenplay, Buck is needy and sensitive, an object equally of sympathy and revulsion. The film chronicles his attempt to rekindle his childhood bond with his old friend Charlie (Chris Weitz), who has grown into a distant, self-absorbed careerist. Mr. Arteta's visual sense, Mr. White's insightful script and strong supporting performances from Mr. Weitz and his brother Sam, as well as from Lupe Ontiveros as a kindly theater manager, make this one of the most unusual and affecting coming-of-age stories in some time. ''Chuck and Buck'' is an antidote to the current epidemic of lazy nostalgia for the innocence of childhood and therefore, magically, one of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to see this year. &#151; A.
