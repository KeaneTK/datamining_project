Mr. Kitano directed, edited and wrote &quot;Brother&quot; (aniki is Japanese for brother), and his style of close-to-the-vest brutality travels extremely well. Aniki ends up in the United States, fleeing waves of trouble left in his wake in Japan, where the murder of his boss has caused a gang war. He transplants himself to Los Angeles, where his half-brother Ken (Claude Maki) is a small-time drug dealer who runs with a crew of lowlifes who seem to be even worse at a criminal lifestyle than he is. Soon, Aniki and his New World pickup crew are dropping some Old World vengeance on any pack of criminals in their way and setting into motion the kind of forces that will demand addressing. Though this is territory that Mr. Kitano has covered before, he underlines the differences between Japan and the United States to make dramatic points and give his solemn toughness a context. - Elvis Mitchell \r\n", "multimedia": null, "display_title": "Brother", "critics_pick": 0, "mpaa_rating": "R", "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:28:05", "opening_date": null, "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9505E6DF133AF934A1575AC0A9669C8B63", "type": "article", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Brother"}, "publication_date": "2000-09-27"}, {"byline": "A.
