They include the eager and happy Boston teenagers of the Klezmaniacs, bringing their sound to a land that has developed an appreciation for it. The movie obviously wants to demonstrate the oddity of the situation, but having someone reduce the Jewish experience to a vehicle for klezmer cheapens the case &quot;Street&quot; is trying to make; the audience members don't need to be sold on a subject they have already left their homes to see. Such an oversimplification seems ill-considered; it would be like saying the black experience in America could only be scored by the blues &#151; the type of patronizing remark that, once upon a time, people did make as a matter of course. &#151; Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null, "display_title": "Klezmer on Fish Street", "critics_pick": 0, "mpaa_rating": "", "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:27:28", "opening_date": null, "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9504EFDE153BF935A25757C0A9629C8B63", "type": "article", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Klezmer on Fish Street"}, "publication_date": "2004-04-16"}, {"byline": "Stephen Holden", "headline": "A Life With Lots of Sex but Hardly Any Laughter", "summary_short": "Enduring this black-and-white mood piece from Mexico is like putting up with an  acquaintance who drones on and on about the pain of an unrequited love.

But its contradictions are subsumed under a high concept: &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; meets &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; in the land of &quot;As You Like It,&quot; with Shakespeare's Forest of Arden turned into a West  Hollywood drag club. Here Connie (Nia  Vardalos) and Carla (Toni Collette), two  bedraggled female veterans of the dinner-theater circuit on the run from mobsters, become  overnight (and highly unlikely) cult stars by posing as gay drag performers singing  Broadway standards. The movie knows and doesn't care that it has only the most tenuous connection to the real world. As drag performers, Ms. Collette (who at times resembles John Epperson as Lypsinka) is far more adroit at caricature than Ms. Vardalos, whose alter-ego suggests a homier, drag version of Kathy Najimy with a smirk that evokes traces of Mary Martin and Phyllis Diller.

The Punisher (Tom Jane) starts out as Frank Castle, a retired F.B.I. agent who falls afoul of a villainous mogul (John Travolta). After the bad guy's minions kill off Castle's entire extended family (with special attention to his wife and young son), Castle transforms himself into a ruthless, low-tech superhero, armed with guns, knives, military training and a portable fire hydrant. In attempting to answer the sadism of his enemies, he exceeds it, and Jonathan Hensleigh, a screenwriter making his directing debut, stages the mayhem with grim and ugly relish. \u2014 A. O.
