As played by Greg Kinnear, Crane is an affable, charming fellow undone by fame, promiscuity and videotape. His sex addiction is made creepier by his compulsion to record his trysts with the aid of technology supplied by John Carpenter (Willem Dafoe), a video expert who was later tried in Crane's murder, and acquitted (a verdict the film regards with implicit skepticism). Despite Mr. Kinnear's smart, vivid performance, the movie keeps Crane at a distance. Mr. Schrader is ultimately less interested in the man than in the condition, and he has produced a moral tale that is chilling and disturbing but never really moving. \u2014 A. O.
