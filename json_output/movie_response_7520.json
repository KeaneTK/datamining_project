Roseanne Barr is the voice of Maggie, a show cow who's now homeless; her spiky, slightly sour delivery gives &quot;Range&quot; some needed breathing room. Her owner was forced to sell his farm after the rustler Alameda Slim (Randy Quaid) cleaned him out of cow and home. Maggie is deposited at Patch of Heaven, a dairy farm, where she meets up with two other heifers: the prim Brit Mrs. Caloway (Judi Dench) and Grace (Jennifer Tilly). When Patch of Heaven, also on the verge of failure, is about to be put on the auction block, Maggie convinces her new friends to capture Slim; the bounty on his head is just enough to save the farm from extinction.

Shooting in a stark black-and-white meant to evoke the socialist realist filmmaking of the 1930's, Pyotr Lutski is making a nostalgic appeal to an era that does not seem entirely worthy of such romantic reconsideration.  But at the same time, he has built so much postmodern irony into his film that it's hard to know where satire stops and sincerity begins.  Is Mr. Lutski endorsing his protagonists' brutal tactics or is he making fun of them?  Are they admirable role models from Russia's lost past or are they idiot thugs still employing the tactics of Stalin's secret police?
