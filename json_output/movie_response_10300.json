It is also a computer- and video-age tribute to Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 film ''Blow Up'' that explores the limitations of truth as revealed through pictures. Bill Pullman is bracingly feisty as a producer of action-adventure films whose macho brio is shattered after he is carjacked and nearly killed, and he goes into hiding. Andie MacDowell is his neglected wife who seizes his empire after his disappearance. Gabriel Byrne is the ambivalent mastermind behind an elaborate surveillance system that the Government is secretly testing in Los Angeles. While monitoring that system, he is witness to a crime he doesn't understand. Ry Cooder composed the gorgeous, shivering musical score. &#151; Stephen Holden", "multimedia": null, "display_title": "The End of Violence", "critics_pick": 1, "mpaa_rating": "R", "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:51:31", "opening_date": "1997-09-12", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E04EED71339F931A2575AC0A961958260", "type": "article", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of The End of Violence"}, "publication_date": "1997-09-12"}, {"byline": "Janet Maslin", "headline": "Bandwagon (Movie)  ", "summary_short": "The scruffy, tenderly funny story of a fledgling rock band from Raleigh, N.C., made with more finesse than its low budget or laid-back atmosphere might suggest. John Schultz brings a fond, knowing perspective to the world of the garage band, but his previous experience making promotional documentaries about Steven Spielberg movies also shows. Sweet and rueful, with a fresh, likable cast, solid comic timing and a chatty tone that owes much to Richard Linklater and Kevin Smith. Matthew Hennessey, as the group's drummer, shows off a slacker's gift of gab, while Kevin Corrigan plays a more stoned, seasoned rocker with a body that goes fishing, a mind ''somewhere between the tangerine trees and the marmalade skies.'' This breezy independent film places as high a value on spontaneity and freedom as its characters do.
