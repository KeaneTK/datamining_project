Offering few laughs and a climactic scene of breathtaking cruelty, the plot-heavy movie draws you against your will into its malignant force field. Almost from the  beginning, the film's sugary and rancid strains work against each other. To put it another  way, &quot;Little Black Book&quot; would like to be a wised-up but still starry-eyed &quot;Working Girl&quot;  and a more acerbic &quot;Broadcast News.&quot; In trying to be both things at once, it can't hold a candle to either forerunner. Batting her large vacant eyes and sucking  her lower lip into a pout, Ms. Murphy suggests a dumbed-down Meg Ryan with a gloss  of Melanie Griffith. \u2014 Stephen Holden", "multimedia": null, "display_title": "Little Black Book", "critics_pick": 0, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:45:08", "opening_date": "2004-08-06", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9900E6D6153CF935A3575BC0A9629C8B63", "type": "article", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Little Black Book"}, "publication_date": "2004-08-06"}], "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.
